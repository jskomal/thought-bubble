## Features

- [x] Enter a title and Body of an idea, then click Save to save the idea and display it on the site.
- [x] Error Handling: Saving an Idea requires both a title and a body
- [x] Search Ideas allows non-case-sensitive filtering of both Title and Body content
- [x] Once an idea is saved and displayed you can favorite or delete it.
- [x] Showed Starred Ideas enables users to show favorited ideas and hide non-favorited ideas and move between the two views as needed.
